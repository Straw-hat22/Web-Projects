# My Web Development Learning Repository ðŸš€

Welcome to my web development learning repository! This repository is part of my journey into **cybersecurity**,
where Iâ€™m first learning how web technologies work before diving into their vulnerabilities and security aspects.
Each project here reflects my progress in understanding the building blocks of web applications,
which is essential for identifying and mitigating security risks in the future.

## About This Repository

This repository is a collection of projects and exercises that Iâ€™ve built while learning web development.
My ultimate goal is to specialize in **cybersecurity**,
but I believe that to secure something, you first need to understand how it works.
Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m focusing on mastering web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Laravel.

### Why This Repository Exists:
- To build a strong foundation in web development, which is critical for understanding application security.
- To practice implementing features and functionalities that are common in web applications.
- To prepare myself for learning about vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, insecure APIs) and secure coding practices.

## How This Relates to Cybersecurity

As part of my journey into **cybersecurity**, Iâ€™m first focusing on understanding how web applications are built. This knowledge is essential for:
- Identifying vulnerabilities in web applications (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, CSRF).
- Implementing secure coding practices.
- Conducting penetration testing and ethical hacking.

Once Iâ€™ve mastered the basics of web development, I plan to dive deeper into security topics, such as:
- Web application vulnerabilities and exploits.
- Secure coding practices.
- Tools and techniques for penetration testing.
