My Web Development Learning Repository ðŸš€
Welcome to my web development learning repository! This is part of my journey into cybersecurity, where Iâ€™m first learning how web technologies work before diving into their vulnerabilities and security aspects. Each project here reflects my progress in understanding the building blocks of web applications, which is essential for identifying and mitigating security risks.

About This Repository
This repository contains projects and exercises Iâ€™ve built while learning web development. My ultimate goal is to specialize in cybersecurity, but I believe that to secure something, you first need to understand how it works. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m focusing on mastering web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Laravel.

Folder Structure
1. Front-End Projects
Focus: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation.

Goals: CRUD operations, dynamic UI updates, responsive design.

2. Back-End Projects (Coming Soon)
Focus: Node.js, Express, databases (MongoDB, MySQL).

Goals: RESTful APIs, authentication, and authorization.

3. Laravel Projects (Coming Soon)
Focus: Laravel (routing, controllers, views, Eloquent ORM).

Goals: Full-stack applications, Blade templates.

Security Note ðŸ”’
While building these projects, Iâ€™m aware they may contain security vulnerabilities. This is intentional at this stage, as my goal is to first understand how web applications work before securing them.

My Plan:
Learn Vulnerabilities: Study specific vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, CSRF).

Exploit and Fix: Intentionally exploit vulnerabilities in my projects, then implement fixes.

Document: Record findings, exploits, and fixes to reinforce learning.

Why This Approach?
Hands-On Learning: Gain a deeper understanding of vulnerabilities and prevention.

Progressive Improvement: Projects will evolve to become more secure over time.

Real-World Relevance: Mimics real-world scenarios of identifying and mitigating risks.

How This Relates to Cybersecurity
Understanding web development is critical for:

Identifying vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, CSRF).

Implementing secure coding practices.

Conducting penetration testing and ethical hacking.

Once I master the basics, Iâ€™ll dive deeper into:

Web application vulnerabilities and exploits.

Secure coding practices.

Penetration testing tools and techniques.
